# CacheItUp - Geocache Proposal

Welcome to the **CacheItUp** Geocache Proposal website! This website is designed as an interactive geocache experience where users follow clues and solve puzzles to uncover the final destination. This is a fun, engaging, and creative treasure hunt that leads participants through different stops, with each one bringing them closer to the final treasure.

## Features

- **Interactive Geocaching**: Users must follow clues to advance through various stops in the journey.
- **Code Unlocking**: Each stop requires a passcode to proceed to the next clue.
- **Final Treasure Reveal**: Upon reaching the final stop, the real treasure is revealed.
  
## How It Works

The site consists of multiple "stops" where participants must enter the correct code in order to proceed to the next clue. Each stop contains a description, a clue, and an input field for the user to enter the correct code. Upon entering the correct code, the next clue will be revealed.

### Stop 1: Zaharakos üç¶
A sweet location to start the journey. The clue at this stop will guide you to the next destination.

### Stop 2: Friendship Alley üåà
A colorful path awaits! Solve the riddle at this stop and enter the correct passcode to move forward.

### Stop 3: Washington Street Trees ‚ú®
The journey culminates here, where you will unlock the final message.

### Final Message
Once the final clue is solved, the real prize is revealed. üéâ
